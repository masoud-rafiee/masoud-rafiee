### Overview

I build **clean, production-minded software** with a focus on:
- backend and full-stack systems
- applied machine learning
- correctness, testing, and maintainability

I value clear architecture, disciplined git workflows, and code that is easy to reason about under scale.

### Featured Work

| Project | Focus | Summary |
|------|------|------|
| **ToCampus (MVP)** | Full-Stack Systems | React + Node.js platform with role-based access, admin workflows, and CI/CD automation |
| **Hybrid Recommender System** | Applied ML | Neural recommendation engine optimized with GA/PSO on MovieLens (reproducible pipeline) |
| **MLP Face Recognition** | Machine Learning | Supervised neural network achieving ~96% accuracy on Olivetti Faces dataset |
| **Memory Manager (C)** | Systems Programming | Custom heap allocator demonstrating low-level memory management and pointer safety |
| **AI Search Maze Visualizer** | Algorithms | BFS, DFS, and A* comparison with real-time visualization |

Each featured repository includes:
- clear README and architecture notes
- reproducible setup
- tests or validation
- CI via GitHub Actions

---

### Engineering Standards

- CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
- Clean commit history and PR-based workflows  
- Linting and testing where applicable  
- Reproducible environments and documented setup  
- No committed build artifacts or IDE files  

I treat repositories as long-lived engineering assets, not assignment dumps.

### Technical Stack

**Languages**
- Python, C++, C, Java, JavaScript

**Machine Learning**
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy

**Systems & Tooling**
- Linux, Git, Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

**Backend / Full-Stack**
- Node.js, MongoDB, REST APIs
